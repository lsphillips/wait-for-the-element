[![Available from NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/wait-for-the-element.svg?maxAge=900)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-for-the-element)
[![Built using GitHub Action](https://github.com/lsphillips/wait-for-the-element/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/lsphillips/wait-for-the-element/actions)

A utility library that enables you to efficiently wait for an element to appear or disappear.

## Usage

This module can be treated as an ES module:

``` js
import { waitForTheElement, waitForTheElementToDisappear } from 'wait-for-the-element';
```

This module can also be treated as a CommonJS module:

``` js
const { waitForTheElement, waitForTheElementToDisappear } = require('wait-for-the-element');
```

### Waiting for an element

You can wait for an element to match a provided selector and retrieve it:

``` js
const element = await waitForTheElement('.target', {
  timeout : 5000
});

if (element === null)
{
  // After 5 seconds, a matching element still doesn't exist.
}
```

**Important Note:** If the selector matches multiple elements, only the first match will be returned.

### Waiting for an element to disappear

You can wait for all elements to stop matching a provided selector:

``` js
const hidden = await waitForTheElementToDisappear('.target', {
  timeout : 5000
});

if (!hidden)
{
  // After 5 seconds, a matching element still exists.
}
```

### Selectors

All functions accept CSS selectors supported by `document.querySelector()`.

### Options

All functions accept an optional settings object that control how elements are searched for:

| Options   | Required | Default    | Description                                           |
| --------- | :------: | :--------: | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `timeout` | No       | `2500`     | The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait. |
| `scope`   | No       | `document` | The root element to start searching from.             |
